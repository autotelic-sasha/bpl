# demo template for bpl

It exercises all the features of bpl. 

The template itself is in the folder template.

There are pre-cooked configurations in both ini and json formats (demo_template_config). 


It is also useful for testing that bpl runs correctly: run it by using the provided configurations and check that the output is the same as what is in the correct_output folder. 
Note that file text_file_Replacement8.txt contains GUIDs, they will be different between runs, as they are supposed to be.
